## 📖 Project Description

The Virtual Real Estate Marketplace is a decentralized application (DApp) that enables users to buy, sell, and trade virtual land parcels as blockchain-based tokens. Each property has unique attributes including location coordinates and metadata, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions of virtual real estate assets in metaverse environments, gaming worlds, and virtual ecosystems.

This smart contract provides secure ownership verification, transparent pricing mechanisms, and automated transaction processing through blockchain technology.
